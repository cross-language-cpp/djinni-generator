Djinni is a tool for generating cross-language type declarations and interface bindings. It's designed to connect C++ with either Java or Objective-C.

Djinni generator parses an interface definition file and generates:

- C++ implementations of types (enums, records)
- Java implementations of types
- Objective-C implementations of types
- Python implementation of types
- C++/CLI implementation of types
- C++ code to convert between C++ and Java over JNI
- Objective-C++ code to convert between C++ and Objective-C
- Python and C code to convert between C++ and Python over CFFI
- C++/CLI code to convert between C++ and C#
