# Djinni Generator

![Build](https://github.com/cross-language-cpp/djinni-generator/workflows/CI/badge.svg)

Djinni is a tool for generating cross-language type declarations and interface bindings. It's designed to connect C++ with either Java or Objective-C.

Djinni generator parses an interface definition file and generates:
- C++ implementations of types (enums, records)
- Java implementations of types
- Objective-C implementations of types
- C++ code to convert between C++ and Java over JNI
- Objective-C++ code to convert between C++ and Objective-C.


## Installation

Djinni **requires Java** to be able to execute!

### Linux, macOS

Download the [lastest released binary](https://github.com/cross-language-cpp/djinni-generator/releases/latest/download/djinni), make it executable and put the containing folder on your PATH:

```bash
curl -LO https://github.com/cross-language-cpp/djinni-generator/releases/latest/download/djinni
chmod u+x djinni
export PATH=$(pwd):$PATH
```

Make sure to [put it on your PATH permanently](https://stackabuse.com/how-to-permanently-set-path-in-linux/) once you fell in love with djinni! :blush:

### Windows

Download the [latest released batch file](https://github.com/cross-language-cpp/djinni-generator/releases/latest/download/djinni.bat), copy it where you want and [put the folder on your PATH](https://www.architectryan.com/2018/03/17/add-to-the-path-on-windows-10/).


## Building from source

### Build dependencies

- Java JDK 8 or 11
- [sbt](https://www.scala-sbt.org/)

### Building

To build once:

```bash
sbt compile
```

To automatically re-build on every change, open the sbt shell & prefix `compile` with `~`

```bash
$ sbt
sbt:djinni> ~compile
```


### Running

```bash
sbt "run
    --idl input.djinni
    --cpp-out out/cpp
    --java-out out/java/src
    --jni-out out/java/jni
    --objc-out out/objc"
```

```bash
sbt "run --help"  # show all options
```

*It is important to put `run` and all arguments in `"`, to be able to pass arguments to the executed jar*

### Packaging

To create a standalone jar run

```bash
sbt assembly
```

This will generate a standalone, self-executing jar in `target/bin`.
You can run the jar like this (no need for `java -jar`):

```bash
./djinni --help
```

On Windows the file must be renamed to `djinni.bat` to make it executable.
