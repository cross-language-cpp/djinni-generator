    The generator **requires Java**!

=== "Linux, macOS"

    Download the [lastest released binary](https://github.com/cross-language-cpp/djinni-generator/releases/latest/download/djinni), make it executable and put the containing folder on your PATH:

    ```bash
    curl -LO https://github.com/cross-language-cpp/djinni-generator/releases/latest/download/djinni
    chmod u+x djinni
    export PATH=$(pwd):$PATH
    ```

    Make sure to [put it on your PATH permanently](https://stackabuse.com/how-to-permanently-set-path-in-linux/) once you fell in love with djinni! :blush:
